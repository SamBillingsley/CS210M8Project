# CS210M8Project
This project is a C++ program designed to analyze purchase frequency data from a grocery store. 
I am proud of how I organized the code using different classes to keep things seperate. The program uses user input and counts items despite the capitalization of the word, and it also shows error messages if files are missing.
The hardest parts involved working with iterators and making the menu system run smoothly. I overcame these problems by using google and trial and error.
I think the biggest skill I learned from this project is breaking down big problems into smaller parts. I was also proud to see me get more organized with my code. I did this by using clear names and adding comments to help remember what does what.
